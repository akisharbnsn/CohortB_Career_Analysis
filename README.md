### Performance Review Practices

- Summary: Analyzed how absenteeism and lateness impact employee performance across departments. The dataset was first cleaned through EDA and ensured overall data quality. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to explore the distribution and relationships between key variables like absences, lateness, and performance scores. The data was then grouped by department and performance score to calculate and visualize average attendance patterns.
